I have build this assigment on ubuntu and used g++ compiler to build. This is a read me file to compile my this project.

1) Command to compile the project :
     g++ -std=c++11 sort_file.cpp -o <outfilename>
2) To run ./<outfilename> <input file name>


For example : The following two lines create outfile as exe . While running the ourfile we need to provide the txt file name as I have given the “text.txt”. You can use attached “Text.txt” file as input to this program.

    1)   g++ -std=c++11 sort_file.cpp -o outfile.
   2)  ./outfile text.txt
